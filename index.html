            <h2>!DOCTYPE, HTML, and Head Tags</h2>
            <p>HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly. We can let web browsers know that we are using HTML by starting our document with a document type declaration.
               <br>
               <br>            
            The declaration looks like this:
               <br>
               <br>
            &lt !DOCTYPE html &gt
            </p>
            <p>This declaration is an instruction, and it must be the first line of code in your HTML document. It tells the browser what type of document to expect, along with what version of HTML is being used in the document. For now, the browser will correctly assume that the html in &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt is referring to HTML5, as it is the current standard. In the future, however, a new standard will override HTML5. To make sure your document is forever interpreted correctly, always include &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt at the very beginning of your HTML documents.
               <br>
               <br>
            Lastly, HTML code is always saved in a file with an .html extension.
            </p>   
            <p>The &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt declaration provides the browser with two pieces of information (the type of document and the HTML version to expect), but it doesn’t actually add any HTML structure or content. To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing &lthtml&gt tags after declaring &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt:
               <br>
               <br>
            &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt
            &lthtml&gt
               <br>
               <br>   
            &lt/html&gt
               <br>
               <br>
            Anything between the opening &lthtml&gt and closing &lt/html&gt tags will be interpreted as HTML code. Without these tags, it’s possible that browsers could incorrectly interpret your HTML code.
            </p>
            <p>Information about the page can be provided to the browser by using the &lthead&gt element.
               <br>
               <br>
            Similar to the &ltbody&gt tag, The &lthead&gt element is part of this HTML metaphor. It goes above the &ltbody&gt> element and contains the metadata for a web page. Metadata is information about the page that isn’t displayed directly on the web page. Unlike the information inside of the &ltbody&gt tag, the metadata in the head is information about the page itself.
               <br>
               <br>  
            The opening and closing head tags typically appear as the first item after your first HTML tag.

         <article id="two">
            <h2>Linking to Other Pages</h2>
            <p>One of the powerful aspects of HTML (and the Internet), is the ability to link to other web pages. You can add links to a web page by adding an anchor element &lta&gt and including the text of the link in between the opening and closing tags.
               <br>
               <br>
            The anchor element must have an href attribute in order to link to another location. This attribute (href) stands for hyperlink reference and is used to link to a path, or the address to where a file is located (whether it is on your computer or another location). The paths provided to the href attribute are often URLs. Here is an example of an anchor element with an href:
               <br>
               <br>
            &lta href="https://www.wikipedia.org/"&gtThis Is A Link To Wikipedia&lt/a&gt
               <br>
               <br>               
            When reading technical documentation, you may come across the term hyperlink. This is simply the technical term for link. These terms are often used interchangeably.
               <br>
               <br>
            In addition to linking to other websites, you can also open links to new web pages by using the &lta&gt element's target attribute. The target attribute specifies how a link should open.
               <br>
               <br>
            It’s possible that one or more links on your web page link to an entirely different website. In that case, you may want users to read the linked website, but hope that they return to your web page. This is exactly when the target attribute is useful!
               <br>
               <br>
            For a link to open in a new window, the target attribute requires a value of "_blank". The target attribute can be added directly to the opening tag of the anchor element, just like the href attribute.
               <br>
               <br>
            &lta href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_bear" target="_blank"&gtThe Brown Bear&lt/a&gt
               <br>
               <br>
            It’s likely that you are using a modern browser that opens up websites in new tabs, rather than new windows. Before the advent of browsers with tabs, additional browser windows had to be opened to view more websites. The target="_blank" attribute, when used in modern browsers, will open new websites in a new tab.
               <br>
               <br>
            Many sites also link to internal web pages like Home, About, and Contact. When making multi-page static websites, web developers often store HTML files in the root directory, or a main folder where all the files for the project are stored. As the size of the projects you create grows, you may use additional folders within the main project folder to organize your code.
               <br>
               <br>
            project-folder/ <br>
            |—— about.html <br>
            |—— contact.html <br>
            |—— index.html <br>
               <br>
               <br>
            The example above shows three different files — about.html, contact.html, and index.html in one folder.
               <br>
               <br>
            HTML files are often stored in the same folder, as shown in the example above. If the browser is currently displaying index.html, it also knows that about.html and contact.html are in the same folder. Because the files are stored in the same folder, we can link web pages together using a relative path.
               <br>
               <br>
            &lta href="./contact.html"&gtContact&lt/a&gt
               <br>
               <br>
            In this example, the &lta&gt tag is used with a relative path to link from the current HTML file to the contact.html file in the same folder. On the web page, Contact will appear as a link.
               <br>
               <br>
            A relative path is a filename that shows the path to a local file (a file on the same website, such as ./index.html) versus an absolute path (a full URL, like https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html which is stored in a different folder). The ./ in ./index.html tells the browser to look for the file in the current folder.
               <br>
               <br>
            You’ve probably visited websites where not all links were made up of text. Maybe the links you clicked on were images or some other form of content. Thankfully, HTML allows you to turn nearly any element into a link by wrapping that element with an anchor element. With this technique, it’s possible to turn images into links by simply wrapping the &ltimg&gt element with an &lta&gt element.

            <h2>Semantic HTML</h2>  
            <p>When building web pages, there is a combined use of non-semantic HTML and Semantic HTML. The word semantic means “relating to meaning,” so semantic elements provide information about the content between the opening and closing tags.
               <br>
               <br>   
            By using Semantic HTML, HTML elements are selected based on their meaning, not on how they are presented. Elements such as &ltdiv&gt and &ltspan&gt are not semantic elements since they provide no context as to what is inside of those tags.
               <br>
               <br>
            For example, instead of using a &ltdiv&gt element to contain our header information, we could use a &ltheader&gt element, which is used as a heading section. By using a &ltheader&gt tag instead of a &ltdiv&gt, we provide context as to what information is inside of the opening and closing tag.
               <br>
               <br>
            Semantic HTML is used for three primary reasons:
               <br>
            • Accessibility: Semantic HTML makes webpages accessible for mobile devices and for people with disabilities as well. This is because screen readers and browsers are able to interpret the code better.
               <br>
            • SEO: It improves the website SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, which is the process of increasing the number of people that visit your webpage. With better SEO, search engines are better able to identify the content of your website and weight the most important content appropriately.
               <br>
            • Easy to Understand: Semantic HTML also makes the website’s source code easier to read for other web developers.
               <br>
               <br>
            To better understand this, you can think of comparing non-semantic HTML to going into a store with no signs on the aisles. Since the aisles aren’t labeled, you don’t know what products are in those aisles. However, stores that do have signs for each aisle make it a lot easier to find the items you need, just like Semantic HTML.

            <h2>Header & Nav</h2>
            <p>A &ltheader&gt is a container usually for either navigational links or introductory content containing &lth1&gt to &lth6&gt headings. The example below shows &ltheader&gt in action:
               <br>
               <br>   
            &ltheader&gt
               <br>
               &lth1&gtEverything you need to know about pizza!&lt/h1&gt
               <br>
            &lt/header&gt
               <br>
               <br>
            This can be compared to the code below which uses a &ltdiv&gt tag instead of a &ltheader&gt tag:
               <br>
               <br>
            &ltdiv id="header"&gt
               <br>
               &lth1&gtEverything you need to know about pizza!&lth1&gt
               <br>
            &lt/div&gt
               <br>
               <br>
            By using a &ltheader&gt tag, the code becomes easier to read. It is much easier to identify what is inside of the &lth1&gt‘s parent tags, as opposed to a &ltdiv&gt tag.
               <br>
               <br>
            A &ltnav&gt is used to define a block of navigation links such as menus and tables of contents. It is important to note that &ltnav&gt can be used inside of the &ltheader&gt element but can also be used on its own. Example:
               <br>
               <br>
            &ltheader&gt <br>
              &ltnav&gt <br>
                &ltul&gt <br>
                  &ltli&gt&lta href="#home"&gtHome&lt/a&gt&lt/li&gt <br>
                  &ltli&gt&lta href="#about"&gtAbout&lt/a&gt&lt/li&gt <br>   
            &lt/ul&gt <br>
              &lt/nav&gt <br>
            &lt/header&gt
               <br>

            <h2>Main & Footer</h2> 
            <p>Two more structural elements are &ltmain&gt and &ltfooter&gt. These elements along with &ltnav&gt and &ltheader&gt help describe where an element is located based on conventional web development standards.
               <br>
               <br>
            The element &ltmain&gt is used to encapsulate the dominant content within a webpage. This tag is separate from the &ltfooter&gt and the &ltnav&gt of a web page since these elements don’t contain the principal content. By using &ltmain&gt> as opposed to a &ltdiv&gt element, screen readers and web browsers are better able to identify that whatever is inside of the tag is the bulk of the content.

               <br>
            The content at the bottom of the subject information is known as the footer, indicated by the &ltfooter&gt element. The footer contains information such as: <br>

            <h2>Article & Section</h2> 
            <p>The &ltsection&gt and &ltarticle&gt elements are two eleemnts that reside within the &ltbody&gt tags.
               <br>
               <br>
            &ltsection&gt defines elements in a document, such as chapters, headings, or any other area of the document with the same theme. For example, content with the same theme such as articles about cricket can go under a single &ltsection&gt. A website’s home page could be split into sections for the introduction, news items, and contact information.
               <br>
               <br>               
            The &ltarticle&gt element holds content that makes sense on its own. &ltarticle&gt can hold content such as articles, blogs, comments, magazines, etc. An &ltarticle&gt tag would help someone using a screen reader understand where the article content (that might contain a combination of text, images, audio, etc.) begins and ends.

This element can be used alongside other elements such as &ltarticle&gt or &ltsection&gt. Some common uses of the &ltaside&gt element are for:<br>
                  • Bibliographies<br>

            <p>Similar to the &ltaside&gt element, we can also use the &ltfigure&gt and &ltfigcaption&gt to put additional images or illustrations nexts to a main piece of content.
               <br>
               <br>
            &ltfigure&gt is an element used to encapsulate media such as an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc, which is referenced in the main flow of the document.
               <br>
               <br>               
            It’s possible to add a caption to the image by using &ltfigcaption&gt. &ltfigcaption&gt is an element used to describe the media in the &ltfigure&gt tag. Usually, &ltfigcaption&gt will go inside &ltfigure&gt, which is helpful if the &ltfigure&gt content gets moved around the page. If and when the &ltfigure&gt moves, the &ltfigcaption&gt will also move along with it.

            <h2>Audio and Attributes</h2>  
            <p>The &ltaudio&gt element is used to embed audio content into a document. Like &ltvideo&gt, &ltaudio&gt uses src to link the audio source.

            In the code above, an &ltaudio&gt element was created along with a &ltsource&gt element. iAmAnAudioFile.mp3 is the audio file and the audio type is specified. It is preferred to always state the type of audio as it helps the browser identify it more easily and determine if that type of audio file is supported by the browser.
               <br>
               <br>
            Additionally, audio can be given controls with the use of attributes.Attributes provide additional information about an element and allow the user to do many different things to the audio file. Some examples of these attributes include: <br>
                  • controls: automatically displays the audio controls into the browser such as play and mute.<br>
                  • src: specifies the URL of the audio file.

               <br>
            &ltvideo src="coding.mp4" controls&gtVideo not supported&lt/video&gt
               <br>
               <br>
            In the code above, the “Video not supported” will only show up if the browser is unable to display the video. Another tag that can be used to incorporate media content into a page is the <embed> tag, which can embed any media content including videos, audio files, and gifs from an external source. This means that websites that have an embed button have some form of media content that can be added to other websites. The &ltembed&gt tag is a self-closing tag, unlike the &ltvideo&gt element. Note that &ltembed&gt is a deprecated tag and other alternatives, such as &ltvideo&gt, &ltaudio&gt and &ltimg&gt should be used in its place.
